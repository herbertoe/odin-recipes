    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Feed the family this comforting, budget-friendly sausage ragu with pasta. You can freeze the 
        leftovers for another time and it tastes just as good.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 large garlic cloves, crushed</li>
        <li>¼ tsp chilli flakes</li>
        <li>2 rosemary sprigs, leaves finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 x 400g cans chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 tbsp brown sugar</li>
        <li>6 pork sausages</li> 
        <li>150ml whole milk</li>
        <li>1 good handful fresh basil</li>
        <li>1 lemon, zested</li>
        <li>350g rigatoni pasta</li>
        <li>grated parmesan and ½ small bunch parsley, leaves roughly chopped, to serve</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 2 tbsp of the oil in a saucepan over a medium heat. Fry the onion with a pinch of salt for 7 mins. Add the garlic, chilli and rosemary, and cook for 1 min more. 
            Tip in the tomatoes and sugar, and simmer for 20 mins.</li>
        <li>Heat the remaining oil in a medium frying pan over a medium heat. Squeeze the sausagemeat from the skins and fry, breaking it up with a wooden spoon, for 5-7 mins until golden. Add to the sauce with the milk and lemon zest, then simmer for a further 5 mins. To freeze, leave 
            to cool completely and transfer to large freezerproof bags.</li>
        <li>Cook the pasta following pack instructions. Drain and toss with the sauce. Scatter over the parmesan and parsley leaves to serve.</li>
