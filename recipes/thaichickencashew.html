    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sweet dark soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon fish sauce</li>
        <li>1 heaping tablespoon brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the Stir-Fry</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable or peanut oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic - peeled and minced</li>
        <li>1/2 small yellow onion - quartered</li> 
        <li>4 finger-length dried red chilies - such as chile de arbol, seeded and cut into halves</li>
        <li>1/2 cup roasted cashew nuts</li>
        <li>8 ounces boneless - skinless chicken breast, cut into thin pieces (about one large chicken breast - hold your knife at an angle
             and slice against the grain to get the thinnest pieces possible)</li>
        <li>1 green onion - cut into 1‚Äù lengths</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisk all of the sauce ingredients together in a small bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat the oil in a wok or large frying pan for 5 minutes over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot enough to produce a sizzle when a drop of water hits it, add in all of the cashew nuts. Fry the cashews until they turn light brown, just a few minutes. Remove them from the oil with a slotted spoon and set them on a paper towel to rest.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic, onion, and dried red chilies to the oil. Stir-fry for 3-5 minutes or until you can start to smell the spicy aroma of the chilies. Add in the chicken and continue to stir-fry until the chicken turns opaque and is cooked through (about 4-5 minutes). Return the cashews to the pan and toss to distribute around the pan.</li>
        <li>Add the sauce to the wok and toss all of the ingredients to coat them well. Turn off the heat and add in the chopped scallions. Serve immediately with a side of jasmine rice.</li>
    </ol>
